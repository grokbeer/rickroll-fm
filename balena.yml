  ## Usage instructions

  **Application download**

  Once you power up your device you'll need to allow some time for it to
  download the application, but it's less than 10MB so should only take a couple
  of minutes depending on your Internet connection.

  **Usage**

  When the download is completed the application will start and begin playing the
  Rickroll track immediately. Tune an FM radio to the chosen frequency (defaults to
  106.9 MHz) and you should hear it playing, but the volume may be quite low.
  The music will loop continuously.
  
  Without an antenna attached to the Raspberry Pi the signal will only transmit ~10 cm.
  See the [Make Magazine artcle](https://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pirate-radio/)
  for instructions on how to attach an antenna, but be aware of your legal obligations.

  **Legal disclaimer**

  Rickroll FM is an experimental project, designed only for experimentation.

  In most countries, transmitting radio waves without a state-issued licence specific
  to the transmission modalities (frequency, power, bandwidth, etc.) is illegal.
  Some countries allow personal FM transmitters (e.g. for in-car audio) but with strict
  power and transmission distance limits.

  Balena or this project can not be held liable for any misuse of your own Raspberry Pi.
  Any use of this project is made under your own responsibility.
