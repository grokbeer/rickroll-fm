# Inspiration

Based on PiFM, originally created by [Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl](http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter) and featured in [Make Magazine](https://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pirate-radio/).

This awesome project allows your Raspberry Pi (models 1, 2 and 3 currently supported) to broadcast an FM radio station just by using one of its onboard GPIO pins!
 
## Legal disclaimer

Rickroll FM is an experimental project, designed only for experimentation.

In most countries, transmitting radio waves without a state-issued licence specific to the transmission modalities (frequency, power, bandwidth, etc.) is illegal.
Some countries allow personal FM transmitters (e.g. for in-car audio) but with strict power and tranmission distance limits.

This project can not be held liable for any misuse of your own Raspberry Pi.  Any use of this project is made under your own responsibility.

## Setup and configuration

Running this project is as simple as joining the [rickroll-fm](https://hub.balena.io/grokbeer/rickroll-fm) balenaCloud fleet. 

You can also deploy it to your own private balenaCloud fleet by using the button below:
